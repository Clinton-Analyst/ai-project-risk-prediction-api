# Project Reflection – AI-Powered Project Risk Prediction System and a dashboard

## Objective

To build an end-to-end AI system integrating machine learning, API development, database management, and dashboard visualization.


## Challenges ENCOUNTERED

- API hanging due to localhost DNS resolution issue
- MySQL connection blocking FastAPI startup
- Debugging silent server failures
- Integrating ML model into production backend


## Key Lessons Learned

- Importance of using 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost in Windows
- Database connections can block server startup
- Clean API structure improves scalability
- Real-world debugging is stressful but requires grit mindset


## Skills LEARNT

- FastAPI backend development
- SQLAlchemy ORM
- MySQL integration
- ML model deployment
- Streamlit dashboard development
- Git & GitHub workflow

## AREAS TO IMPROVE

- Add authentication
- Add historical analytics charts 
- Deploy to cloud platform

## CONCLUSION

This project transformed my understanding of AI integration from theory to real-world system building. I have learnt how to use AI in learning, comprehending existing codebases, debugging and finally documentation.
